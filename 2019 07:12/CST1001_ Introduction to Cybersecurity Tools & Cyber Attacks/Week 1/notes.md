### Triad Components

- Confidentiality

  Access to resources or data must be restricted to only authorized subjects or entities.

  - Methods: Data encryption

- Integrity

  Ensuring consistency and accuracy of data over its entire life cycle — data must not be changed in transit.

  - Methods: Hash values (provided by the author of the downloaded file, compared with the hash value of the downloaded file)

- Availability

  Ensuring that business operations are up and running, firewalls, proxies, computers everything has to be up and running.

  - Methods: Hardware and software maintenance and upgrades; business continuity plans, disaster recovery, redundancies

### Key Terms

The following are to be considered when designing a business continuity plan.

- Vulnerability

  Flaw, loophole, oversight, or error that can be exploited to violate system security policy.
  e.g. Code that is vulnerable to a [buffer overflow exploit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/buffer-overflow-attack-with-example/)

  - _Vulnerability assessment_ is the process of identifying, analysing, and ranking vulnerabilities — followed by a patch or a fix to prevent a compromise.

- Threat

  Natural or man-made event that has potential to cause negative impact to an organisation.
  e.g. Hacking, natural disasters

  - Security Threats
    - Human Factors
      - Internal Threats
        e.g. Employees, both former and current
      - External Threats
        e.g. Hackers, crackers, viruses, Trojans, worms
    - Natural Factors
      e.g. Natural disasters

- Exploit

  A defined way to breach the security of an IT system through a vulnerability.
  e.g. Code that is available on the Internet, which can be used to attack a vulnerable application

- Risk

  Situations involving exposure to danger.
  e.g. Probability of a vulnerability being exploited
