### Key Findings from the IBM X-Force Report:

- The **finance and insurance industry** — at 19 percent of total attacks and incidents — continues to be the most targeted industry, attracting attackers in every geography.

  [There is a lot of money in these industries, and a lot of people do not necessarily protect their accounts, or their systems.]

- Coming in second, at 13 percent of total attacks and incidents, is **transportation services** ... transportation sector to continue rising as an attractive target for malicious actors, because of the industry’s reliance on information technology to facilitate operations, its ubiquitous need for integration of third-party vendors, and its vast supply chain. These factors make for a _larger attack surface_ than other industries.

- In 2018, the media sector topped the chart with 40 percent of publicly disclosed incidents. Half of these incidents involved misconfigured cloud servers and other improperly configured systems ...

- ... the US topped the chart as the number one host of malware command-and-control (C&C) servers in 2018 with 36 percent of the total number of C&C servers.

- Publicly disclosed misconfiguration incidents increased 20 percent year-over-year. Even so, misconfigurations were not responsible for as many compromised records as 2017 ...

- ... illicit cryptojacking attacks are on the rise while ransomware seems to be on the decline. Over the course of 2018, attempts to install ransomware on X-Force monitored devices in Q4 (Oct.- Dec.) declined to less than half (45 percent) of the attempts in Q1. Meanwhile, cryptojacking attacks more than quadrupled in the same timeframe increasing 450 percent.

- Nearly one-third of attacks analyzed by X-Force IRIS involved compromises via phishing emails. Of those, 45 percent involved business email compromise (BEC) scams, also known as “CEO fraud” or whaling attacks ... They are sent to those who control the company’s bank accounts with instructions to execute a confidential wire transfer. The transfer ends up in accounts the criminals control. The FBI reports that BEC fraud has been growing rapidly in the US and across the globe, having cost organizations \$12.5 billion at last count.
