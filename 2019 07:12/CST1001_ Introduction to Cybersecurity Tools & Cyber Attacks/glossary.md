- coin-mining malware (cryptojacking)

  the act of installing a cryptocurrency miner on the victim’s endpoint without their knowing it, thus enslaving their device to slowly gather coins for the attacker.

  [This operation taxes the device’s CPU/GPU, is costly in terms of electric power, and can cause damage to devices as they overheat. If coin-mining malware is on organizational networks, it can mean the threat actor has breached the network and it’s allowing the network to be exploited by other malicious actors with different, more detrimental objectives.]
