- coin-mining malware (cryptojacking)

  the act of installing a cryptocurrency miner on the victim’s endpoint without their knowing it, thus enslaving their device to slowly gather coins for the attacker.

  [This operation taxes the device’s CPU/GPU, is costly in terms of electric power, and can cause damage to devices as they overheat. If coin-mining malware is on organizational networks, it can mean the threat actor has breached the network and it’s allowing the network to be exploited by other malicious actors with different, more detrimental objectives.]

  The Morris Internet Worm source code, a 99-line program that brought large pieces of the Internet to a standstill on 2nd Nov 1988. It was the first of many intrusive programs that utilised the Internet as a medium to spread itself.

  Worm propagation, a loop-cascade:

  - Step 1: Find a target (another computer to connect to, e.g. create a TCP/IP address)
  - Step 2: Copy worm to target (e.g. with browsers, with different types of runtime environments, exploit bugs in software to copy executables to another machine)
  - Step 3: Remote execution of program on target

  [Potentially, before the worm program is executed, we can task it to look around the host program, such as checking for passwords. What other activities can be done to make it lethal?]
