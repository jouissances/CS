# What is the Purpose of Cybersecurity?

- Thinking about cybersecurity in terms of the **Reference Monitor Concept**: As active entities try to reach passive repositories (assets), cybersecurity sits in the middle. As requests come in to access a resource, cybersecurity says yes-or-no.

- In other words, based on policy, the idea is to either allow or disallow access to a resource.

- This model is also called the _subject-object model_ (active entities and passive repositories) of cybersecurity.

- This model doesn't fulfil all scenarios, one of which may be when there are more than one active entities interacting with one another. However, the basic concept is cybersecurity says yes-or-no to the active entities.

- Security can be interpreted as an enabler instead of a blocker — through the implementation of protocols and policies to ensure that a transaction is safe to complete, enabling subjects and objects to communicate.

### Adversaries

- In cybersecurity, adversaries are the focus — not natural disasters, or an inadvertent piece of code causing a problem. Cybersecurity is about intentional malicious activities.

- There are generally 4 types of adversaries:

  - Hackers
    - Motivation: Mischief
    - Attributes: Individually capable, predictable
  - Criminals
    - Motivation: Greed
    - Attributes: Well-funded, financially motivated
  - Hacktivists
    - Motivation: Anger
    - Attributes: Group-oriented, unpredictable
  - Nation-state Actors
    - Motivation: Dominance
    - Attributes: World-class capability and resources

- It is far more difficult to think of defenses than offensive hacking, to protect a system rather than break it.
