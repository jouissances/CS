- Claim: For every input array of n numbers, Merge Sort produces a sorted output array and uses at most 6n log<sub>2</sub>n + 6n operations.

- Recursion tree proof: To write out all the work done by the recursive merge sort algorithm in a tree structure with the children of a given node corresponding to the recursive calls made by that node. [Proof](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer/lecture/wW9On/merge-sort-analysis)

- [Assumptions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer/lecture/q5fV4/guiding-principles-for-analysis-of-algorithms)

  - worst-case analysis
  - ignore small constants
  - asymptotic analysis

- [Principles for analysis of algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer/lecture/q5fV4/guiding-principles-for-analysis-of-algorithms)

- Fast algorithm, in this course, is an algorithm whose worst-case running tim grows slowly with input size.

- The holy grail of algorithm is to have a linear (or close to linear) time algorithm, whose number of instructions grows proportionally with the input size.
