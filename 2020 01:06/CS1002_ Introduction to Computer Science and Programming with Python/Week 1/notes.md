# Roadmap

[] data structures
[] iteration and reucrsion as computational metaphors
[] abstraction of procedures and data types
[] organise and modularise systems using object classes and methods
[] different classes of algorithms, searching, and sorting
[] complexity of algorithms

## Notes

- Computers perform calculations at 1 billion calculations per second. Faster than light?
- They also remember results — hundreds of GB of storage
- Every computer can understand built-in languages and do built-in procedures, with more defined by the programmer
- 10^123 differenet ways to play chess vs. 10^80 atoms in our observable universe
- Limitations to computer mainly are not caused by lack of speed — they are caused by problems which are too complex, insufficient data, encrypted schemes, etc.
- Classic [Turing Halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) and first order logic
- It is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running (i.e., halt) or continue to run forever.
